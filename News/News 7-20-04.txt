Upon request from my confident, I have submitted to once again updating the website.  A lot of stuff has happened in the past 3 months.  First off, went to La Rev in New York and stayed at Nates (Franky and my little brother tagged along).  I hooked them up with some sweatshirts and they got rowdy - due to having so much fun!  City hall got capped, old news I know, but most of the skate stoppers are gone now.  I sprained my ankle climbing a foot high rock with aaron (ex-member of hope dies), awsome!  New shirt designs are being printed and online shopping will be available soon. So get your credit cards ready!!!
