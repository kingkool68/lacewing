<p><font color="#000000">Welcome to the Lacewing website. The site is 
          finally off the ground and into the interweb. In recent news,<b> Jessie 
          Mademann</b> double pegged a handrail in Kensington. He also nutted 
          first try. <b>Matt Berrian</b> almost pedal grinded the roller coaster 
          ledge at Drexel. Our friend <b>Ralph</b> held a party initiating the 
          spring/summer of 2004. The party had plenty of food, drinks, and a wicked 
          mini ramp session. Sweatshirts are now available in all sizes and colours. 
          <b>Mark Kelley</b> has been addicted to Worms 3D. I think he has mastered 
          the art of that game. <b>Russell Heimlich</b> continues to be a digital 
          nerd making all this stuff before your eyes magically appear. I am still 
          addicted to WaWa chocolate milk and Matt has a haggard beard. <b>Josh 
          Kemp</b> seems to be MIA, and Jessie's ear sticks out an extra couple 
          inches from falling on his face at Drexel. A random at a skatepark asked 
          if Lacewing was a butt plug company [thanks Keith], and I have $100 
          in my pocket. Thats all for the news, listen to Morris Day and the Time.</font></p>
